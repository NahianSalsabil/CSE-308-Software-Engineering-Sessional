# CSE-308 Software Engineering Sessional
This course covered several *design pattern* concepts and some *software testing* methods of software engineering.
- Creational Design Pattern (Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton)
- Structural Design Patter (Adapter, Decorator)
- Behavioural Design Pattern (Observer, Mediator)
- Unit Testing
